# Drone-Reinforcement-Learning-Obstacle-Avoidance
This project implements a sophisticated reinforcement learning system for autonomous drone navigation with real-time obstacle detection and avoidance. The drone learns to navigate complex 3D environments while avoiding static and dynamic obstacles using only onboard sensors.
